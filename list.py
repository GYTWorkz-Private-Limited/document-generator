SOPs are documents that outline regularly recurring operations relevant to the quality of service being rendered. The purpose of an SOP is to ensure that operations are carried out correctly and consistently. These procedures should always be available at the place where the work is done and must be followed as compulsory instructions.\n\nThe objectives of developing SOPs for medicine management include enhancing the quality of services provided, promoting uniformity in services, eliminating operational errors, and elevating the status of pharmacists to enhance their motivation for better performance. SOPs cover various areas such as drug lists, procurement of medicines, receiving drugs into pharmacy, drug storage, vaccine storage, temperature control, issue and delivery of drugs, dispensing, patients counseling, compounding of medicines, and disposal of expired drugs, among others.\n\nFor instance, the SOP for Drug Lists includes preparing an advocacy plan, writing a proposal to set up a drug and therapeutic committee in line with national requirements, identifying drug categories based on the national essential drug list, obtaining approval for the management of the facility, circulating approved lists to stakeholders, and ensuring compliance with the use of the essential drug list.\n\nSimilarly, the SOP for Procurement of Medicines involves preparing an advocacy plan, confirming fund availability, matching needs with funds, identifying and verifying suppliers, choosing a procurement method, preparing an order form, conducting evaluations, submitting recommendations to the tender committee, monitoring suppliers' performance, receiving and storing drugs, facilitating prompt payment, and preparing for the next procurement cycle.\n\nIn conclusion, developing and following SOPs for medicine management is essential in ensuring the efficient and effective delivery of pharmaceutical care in healthcare facilities. By adhering to these standardized procedures, pharmacies can enhance service quality, reduce errors, and improve overall patient care outcomes.", '<section>\n<h2>SOP FOR MEDICINE MANAGEMENT</h2>\n<p>A standard Operating procedure is a document which describes the regularly recurring operations relevant to the quality of service being rendered.
